# Starter API

NestJS API starter for session-based authentication, Google OAuth, role-based access control, user and role management, aggregate stats, CSV user import/export, local avatar uploads, password reset emails, and PostgreSQL persistence with TypeORM.

## Stack

- NestJS 11, TypeScript, Express 5
- TypeORM 0.3 with PostgreSQL
- Passport local, session, and Google OAuth strategies
- Nest CQRS for command/query handlers and event handlers
- PostgreSQL-backed sessions with `connect-pg-simple`
- Nodemailer via `@nestjs-modules/mailer`
- Pino request logging
- Jest, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose, including an Adminer service for local database access

## Features

- Session authentication with Passport local sign-in
- Google OAuth sign-in and redirect flow
- Role-based access control with `admin` and `user` roles
- Global authentication, role, throttling, validation, and response transform layers
- Auth flows for signup, signin, signout, profile updates, password updates, forgot password, and reset password
- User and role CRUD implemented through CQRS command and query handlers
- Admin stats endpoint for user and role totals
- User CSV import and export
- Local avatar uploads served from `/uploads`
- PostgreSQL persistence with TypeORM migrations
- Local seed script for starter admin and user credentials
- Development and production Docker Compose files
- Adminer in the development Compose stack

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm
- PostgreSQL, or Docker for the containerized stack

## Docker

This repo has separate Compose files for development and production:

- `compose.dev.yml` builds the `development` Docker target, runs `pnpm start:dev` with the project bind-mounted into `/app`, and starts Adminer on port `8080`.
- `compose.prod.yml` builds the `production` Docker target and runs the compiled app with `pnpm start:prod`.

Both Compose files run PostgreSQL with `postgres:18-alpine`, read `.env`, require database variables to be set, and wait for the database health check before starting the API. Inside Compose, set `DB_HOST=db` in `.env` so the API connects to the database service.

Start the development stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml -p starter-backend up --build
```

The API is available on `http://localhost:$PORT`. Adminer is available on `http://localhost:8080`.

Run migrations and seeds in the development API container:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml -p starter-backend exec api pnpm build
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml -p starter-backend exec api pnpm db:migrate
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml -p starter-backend exec api pnpm db:up
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml -p starter-backend exec api pnpm db:seed
```

Seed credentials for local development:

- `admin@admin.com` / `admin1234`
- `user@user.com` / `user1234`

Start the production-style stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -p starter-backend up --build
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm start            # run Nest once
pnpm start:dev        # run Nest in watch mode
pnpm start:debug      # run Nest with debugger in watch mode
pnpm build            # compile to dist/
pnpm start:prod       # run dist/src/main
pnpm lint             # run ESLint with fixes
pnpm format           # run Prettier on src/**/*.ts
pnpm test             # run unit tests
pnpm test:watch       # run unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:cov         # run unit tests with coverage
pnpm test:debug       # run Jest with Node inspector
name=my_migration pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:up            # apply migrations
pnpm db:down          # revert last migration
pnpm db:seed          # seed local roles and users
```

Feature modules follow CQRS and barrel exports. Reads live under `queries`, writes under `commands`, and side effects may use `events`. Controllers, DTOs, entities, interfaces, and reusable helpers remain in their dedicated folders. Cross-module data access is performed through the owning module's queries or commands rather than by injecting another module's repository.

## Runtime Notes

- Requests are validated with a global `ValidationPipe` using `transform: true`.
- Responses are wrapped by `TransformInterceptor`.
- CORS is credentialed and reflects the request origin (`origin: true`).
- Sessions use `express-session`, Passport, and a PostgreSQL session store.
- The session cookie is named `sid`; `secure` is enabled when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- The session table is created automatically by `connect-pg-simple` when it is missing.
- Global guards are registered for authentication, roles, and throttling.
- Throttling is configured at 50 requests per 60 seconds.
- `@Public()` marks unauthenticated routes.
- `@Roles([RoleEnum.ADMIN])` restricts routes to admin users.
- Uploaded files are served from `/uploads`.
